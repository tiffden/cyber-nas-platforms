# Novice Shell Integration (Platforms)

Purpose: platform-side integration points for novice/TUI command UX.

Ownership in this repo:
- UI presentation and flow wiring
- platform-specific adapter shims
- mirror copies of command contracts from overlay

Do not define command semantics here; treat overlay command spec as source of truth.
